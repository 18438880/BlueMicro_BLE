Master Build Status: ![Build Status](http://toronto.jpconstantineau.com:8585/buildStatus/icon?job=BlueMicro_BLE%20-%20Push)

Develop Build Status: ![Build Status](http://toronto.jpconstantineau.com:8585/buildStatus/icon?job=BlueMicro_BLE-develop)


**Compabible Hardware**  

* BlueMicro V1.0  (Serial TX/RX routed through D2 and D3; Designed for the ErgoTravel only)
* BlueMicro V1.1  (Compatible with more Keyboards - Serial TX/RX are routed separately) 
* BLE Phage       (Compatible with even more Keyboards due to its small size - Serial USB and PoLi Charger on board)
* BLE Phage Basic (Compatible with even more Keyboards due to its small size - Serial TX/RX are routed separately)
* Adafruit nRF52 Feather (Software compatible - not Pinout compabible)

The firmware uses the same Arduino Core as the [Adafruit nRF52 Feather Boards](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Arduino)

The Adafruit NRF52 Arduino Core is based on [Arduino-nRF5](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-nRF5) by Sandeep Mistry, which in turn is based on the [Arduino SAMD Core](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-samd).

The following tools are used:

- Arduino IDE as the Editing Environment
- GCC ARM Embedded as the compiler
- Nordic's nrfutil 0.5.2 for flashing the firmware by serial interface
- J-Link for flashing the bootloader by SWD interface
