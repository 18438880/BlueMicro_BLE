The source code for a handwired keyboard designed by me called the *AirGo - Dox*
* It is made up by two halves, each with 21 keys
* The computer connects only to the left half, as the halves communicate with each other
* The keyboard has three different layers, each accessible by holding down one of two keys

The keyboard uses two Adafruit nrf52 (nRF52832) boards and switches salvaged from an old Apple AEKII
