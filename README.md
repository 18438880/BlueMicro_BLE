The BlueMicro uses the same Arduino Core as the [Adafruit nRF52 Feather Boards](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Arduino)

The Adafruit NRF52 Arduino Core is based on [Arduino-nRF5](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-nRF5) by Sandeep Mistry, which in turn is based on the [Arduino SAMD Core](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-samd).

The following tools are used:

- Arduino IDE as the Editing Environment
- GCC ARM Embedded as the compiler
- Nordic's nrfutil 0.5.2 for flashing the firmware by serial interface
- J-Link for flashing the bootloader by SWD interface
