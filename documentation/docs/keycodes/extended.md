Firmware only keycodes are keycodes that combine multiple keycodes from the standard HID Usage Tables to generate specific characters.

| Usage ID (HEX) | Usage Name              | Keycode Identifiers        |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 00             | Reserved (No Event)     | KC_NO        XXXXXXX       |

Table is still a work in progress.  Refer to `hid_keycodes.h` and `advanced_keycodes.h` for a detailed list of keycodes.
